# Flu-and-Vaccine-Project
Impact of Influenza Vaccination Coverage on Influenza Burden in the United States

This project investigates the relationship between vaccination rates and reported influenza cases using data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 influenza seasons. 

The data was first cleaned using dplyr, readr, janitor, and stringr packages, and then analysed with the following statistical tests: summary statistics, correlation analysis, multiple linear regression, Welchâ€™s two-sample t-test, and seasonal linear regressions.
